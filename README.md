# Multiplayer-Communication
**This Node.js App supports real-time 3+ multiplayers communications while viewing shared visual contents. This can be adapted to a MTurk HIT easily. Please refer to the code for details.**

Note: This is a substantially refactored fork of [MWERT](https://github.com/hawkrobe/MWERT). The overall framework is the same, but we extract a lot of shared code into the sharedUtils directory, which is imported as a base by all of the individual experiments.
